This is a prototype system for simulating and predicting orbital physics. 
It has the ability to accuratly predict where an object will be in a specified ammount of time in an n-body gravitational simulation.
It also has an on-rails system for planets that supports eccentric.
This system can also display a prediction line for an object in a human-readable manor using seperated lines with different colors do decern
changes in sphere of influence.  It also displays icons at the periapsis and apoapsis of each orbit, and at a detected collision point with a planet.

INSTRUCTIONS:
the ship will try to point at your mouse
press w to apply thrust in the direction that the ship is pointing

The skills I used in creating this project where mainly programming. (its a tech demo...)

It would make a good screensaver if it didnt use so mutch cpu, also you need a decent pc to run this because there isnt really an efficeint
way to calculate a lot of this stuff.  I had to iterate over 500 future physics steps every frame for 20 frames every time the path needs re-calculating
because doing it all at once would drop the fps to around 5.

this is a fairly performance intensive program and will probably not run well on some of the school computers...
